# Swarmify

A swarm of Claude Code agents sharing one graphify memory per world, running gated workflows.
Python core (FastAPI, uv workspace, one package per bounded context), React web skin (Vite, pnpm
workspace), one monorepo. Domain docs live in the Obsidian vault, see `CONTEXT.md`.

## Setup

1. Install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev): `brew install mise`, then activate it in your shell
   (`echo 'eval "$(mise activate zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc`). mise installs the pinned Python, Node, uv
   and pnpm from `mise.toml`; nothing else is needed globally.
2. `mise install` installs the toolchains.
3. `mise run install` installs Python and web dependencies and Playwright's Chromium.

## Tasks

| Task | What it does |
|---|---|
| `mise run dev` | API with reload on :8000 and Vite on :5173 (proxies `/api`) |
| `mise run lint` | ruff, ruff format, pyright, import-boundary check, tsc |
| `mise run test` | pytest with an 85 percent coverage gate, then Vitest (browser mode) |
| `mise run e2e` | builds the web skin and runs Playwright against the real API |
| `mise run gen-client` | regenerates `apps/web/src/api/schema.d.ts` from the OpenAPI schema |
| `uv run swarmify-mcp` | the swarmify MCP server over stdio (`claude mcp add swarmify -- uv run swarmify-mcp`) |

Data lives in `SWARMIFY_DATA_DIR` (default `~/.swarmify`): `swarmify.db`, the DBOS system database
`dbos.sqlite`, and one folder per world under `worlds/<id>/`. The API streams every world's events at `GET /api/worlds/<id>/events` (SSE,
`Last-Event-ID` resumes); the MCP server writes to the same database, so its actions show up there.

## Workflows

A workflow is YAML saved into a world. Every save is a new immutable version; runs pin the version
they started with. Stages are one of four types, each written as `- <type>: <stage name>`:

```yaml
name: Weekly short
schedule: "0 8 * * 1"      # optional cron
budget_usd: 5              # optional
agents: 4                  # optional
stages:
  - swarm: research        # goal, done_when; optional tools, graphs, output_type, produces
    goal: Find 5 ideas trending this week.
    done_when: 5 ideas ranked
    tools: [web_search, graph]
    produces: [ideas.md]
  - gate: pick             # ask; optional kind: pick | approve | confirm
    ask: Pick one idea.
    kind: pick
  - connector: render      # calls (defaults to the stage name); optional input, output, params
    calls: remotion_render
    input: ideas.md
    output: short.mp4
  - workflow: trends       # runs: a workflow id; optional take: artifacts to copy from the child
    runs: wf_01HX...
    take: [brief.md]
```

Rules checked on every save and by the editor as you type, each reported with its stage and a
rule name: a publish connector must come right after a gate (ADR 0007); workflow stages may not
form a cycle and may nest at most two deep (ADR 0013); every connector must exist in the world and
allow the stage type; a connector's `input` must be produced by an earlier stage.
`POST /api/worlds/<id>/workflows` creates, `POST /api/workflows/<id>/versions` appends,
`POST /api/worlds/<id>/workflows/check` only reports. The MCP server exposes `save_workflow`,
`check_workflow`, `list_workflows` and `get_workflow`.

## Runs

`POST /api/workflows/<id>/runs` (body `{"version": n}` optional, the current version otherwise)
starts a run pinned to that version. Each run is one DBOS workflow (ADR 0014) with the run id as
its workflow id and one DBOS step per side effect: load the run, save each new state, execute a
stage. A crash or restart resumes at the last completed step, so a finished stage never runs again.
Runs wait on a queue partitioned by world, at most two running per world.

Run status is one of queued, running, waiting_gate, paused, done, failed, aborted; stage status one
of pending, running, waiting, done, failed, skipped. The rules live in `swarmify_runs.machine`, a
pure function from (stage kinds, state, event) to (next state, commands); the DBOS workflow only
executes the commands. Every state change appends a `run.updated` event carrying the whole run to
the world's stream, which the runs page and the run timeline render live.

A connector stage calls its connector (see Connectors below), a swarm stage runs its worker (see
Agents below); a gate waits for a decision that only `Runner.answer_gate` can send (T05 adds the
inbox and the HTTP and MCP actions), and workflow stages fail the run with a clear error until
child runs (T14) ship.
`GET /api/worlds/<id>/runs` lists runs newest first; `GET /api/runs/<id>` returns one with its stages.

## Connectors

A connector is an MCP server (a command line or an http(s) URL), the credential names it needs,
its kind (tool, stage or publish) and the stage types allowed to use it (swarm, connector). A
publish connector is only ever allowed in connector stages, and the editor makes it follow a gate.
Every world starts with the built-ins: `web_search` and `graph` (swarm tools, no setup) plus
`remotion_render`, `youtube` and `upload_post`, declared so workflows can name them; their servers
ship with T11 and T12, and until then calling one fails the stage with a clear error.

Credentials live in one file, `<data dir>/.env` (`~/.swarmify/.env`), written with mode 600; the
app refuses to read it when group or others can. Values never enter the database, a run, a
workflow or an API response. A command connector gets exactly its own credentials as its process
environment, merged over the MCP SDK's safe defaults (HOME, PATH, USER, SHELL, TERM, LOGNAME); a
URL connector gets them as request headers of the same name.

- `GET /api/worlds/<id>/connectors` lists built-ins first, each with the credential names still
  `missing` from the file.
- `POST /api/worlds/<id>/connectors/test` starts the draft's server once and returns its tools,
  saving nothing. `POST /api/worlds/<id>/connectors` saves it and merges the given credential
  values into the file (an empty value means the file already has it). `DELETE
  /api/connectors/<id>` removes an added one.
- A connector stage calls the tool named like its connector (or `params.tool`) with `params`, its
  `input` and `output` artifact names and `idempotency_key` set to the stage id, through the
  ConnectorTransport port. The call is recorded once per stage id: a finished call is never
  repeated, and a crash mid-job resumes polling instead of calling again.
- A long job answers `{"job_id": ..., "poll": "<tool>"}`; swarmify calls that tool with
  `{"job_id": ...}` every 2 s until it answers `status: done` or `failed`, with optional `progress`
  (0 to 1) and `message`. A wrapper keeps job state outside its process, since every call and
  poll is a fresh MCP session.
- Every change to a call appends a `connector_call.updated` event carrying the whole call, progress
  included; `GET /api/stages/<stage id>/call` returns the raw request and response, which the run
  timeline shows when a connector stage is opened.

## Whiteboard

Each swarm stage has a whiteboard of tasks after the beads model (ADR 0017): a task has a status
(open, claimed, done), an owner, dependencies on other tasks of the stage, a heartbeat, notes and
who added it. A task is claimable once every task it depends on is done. A claim is one
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction updating the row only while it has no owner, so of any number of
concurrent claims exactly one wins and the rest get a 409. The owner heartbeats, optionally with
partial notes; a claim whose last heartbeat is older than two minutes returns to open with its
notes kept and a note saying why (the API sweeps every 15 seconds). Every change appends a
`task.updated` event carrying the whole task, which the run page's whiteboard renders live.

| Action | HTTP | MCP |
|---|---|---|
| Add a task (`title`, optional `body`, `depends_on`, `added_by`) | `POST /api/runs/<run>/stages/<stage>/tasks` | `add_task` |
| List a stage's tasks | `GET /api/runs/<run>/stages/<stage>/tasks` | `list_tasks` |
| Claim, heartbeat, finish (`agent`, optional `note`) | `POST /api/tasks/<id>/claim`, `/heartbeat`, `/finish` | in-process agent tools (T07) |

Tasks can be added to a swarm stage that has not ended; the run page's whiteboard has an add form
for this. The HTTP claim, heartbeat and finish stay alongside the agents' in-process tools, for
operators and for agents outside swarmify (a Claude Code session driving a stage by hand).

## Agents

A swarm stage runs one worker (`worker-1`, Gilfoyle in the skin) through the AgentRuntime port.
The adapter is the Claude Agent SDK, whose wheel bundles the `claude` CLI; sessions run on your
Claude subscription (ADR 0010), so for a headless host run `claude setup-token` once and export
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. Until the planner ships (T08) an empty whiteboard is seeded with one
task, the stage goal, and the stage is done when the worker's session ends cleanly.

- In-process tools (`mcp__swarmify__<name>`): `query_graph`, `list_tasks`, `claim_task` (the named
  task or the next ready one), `heartbeat`, `finish_task`, `add_task`, `write_note`,
  `write_artifact`. Notes land in `worlds/<w>/runs/<run>/<stage>/notes/`, artifacts in
  `.../artifacts/`, each as markdown with frontmatter (a non-markdown artifact gets a `.md`
  sidecar), and each write appends an `artifact.created` event. `query_graph` answers that the
  graph is empty until the graph writer ships (T09).
- Allowlist: the tools above, `Skill`, `Read` (inside the world folder only), plus per stage
  `web_search` (WebSearch, WebFetch) and any connector named in `tools` (`mcp__<name>__*`, its
  server and credentials passed to the session).
- Hooks: a PreToolUse hook writes every tool call to the stage's live log, denies anything outside
  the allowlist and denies a claim until the agent has queried the graph. Each result's estimated
  cost (the SDK's estimate, not billing) is kept on the agent; the run's cost is the sum.
- Skills: the world folder is passed as a local plugin with host settings off
  (`setting_sources=[]`, ADR 0016), so `worlds/<w>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` loads as
  `<world id>:<name>` and nothing from `~/.claude` does. The init message's skill list is stored on
  the agent and logged; plugin errors are logged as errors.
- Sessions: the session id is stored on the agent the moment the session starts. A session that
  dies is replaced once by a session resuming that id; when both die the stage fails. A retried
  stage whose worker finished does not run it again.

`GET /api/runs/<id>/agents` lists a run's agents (status, session, skills, cost) and `GET
/api/runs/<run>/stages/<stage>/log` a stage's live log; `agent.updated` and `agent.logged` events
stream both, and the run page shows them under the timeline.

Tests drive the real SDK client with `swarmify_swarm.fake.Script`, a scripted `claude` CLI behind
the SDK's Transport seam: it answers the initialize handshake, fires the registered hook callbacks
and calls in-process tools over the control protocol, so hooks and tools run for real without a
model. The e2e server (`tests/e2e/scripted_app.py`) runs the same script.

`docker compose up --build` builds the api image (web skin baked in, served at `/`) and a
graph writer stub.

## Layout

- `packages/kernel` shared kernel: ids, the event envelope and its append-only log, SQLite
  access and the migration runner. The only package other packages may import.
- Migrations are numbered SQL files, `NNNN_name.sql`, applied in order and recorded in
  `PRAGMA user_version`. Numbers are global: each package ships its own `migrations/` folder
  (kernel 0001, worlds 0002, workflows 0003, runs 0004, connectors 0005, swarm 0006 and 0007,
  ...) and the composition root passes them all to `migrate` once.
  Adapters never migrate.
- `packages/<context>` one package per bounded context (worlds, workflows, runs, swarm, memory,
  connectors, learning, notifications). `packages/swarm` also declares AgentRuntime, with the
  Agent SDK adapter `SdkRuntime`; `packages/memory` writes notes and artifacts as files. `tools/check_imports.py` fails CI if a context imports
  anything but the kernel and itself. Each context declares its ports in `ports.py` (ADR 0012);
  `packages/worlds`, `packages/workflows`, `packages/runs`, `packages/connectors` and `packages/swarm`
  each have a Storage port with a SQLite adapter.
  Workflows learns which connectors a world allows through a function the composition root passes
  in, backed by the connector registry. `packages/connectors` also declares ConnectorTransport, with
  the MCP adapter and `FakeTransport` for tests.
- `apps/api` FastAPI composition root; serves `apps/web/dist` at `/` when it exists. Also home of
  the `swarmify-mcp` server, which exposes the same actions as MCP tools.
- `apps/web` React skin with a typed client generated by openapi-typescript.
- `tests/e2e` Playwright for Python against the real API.
